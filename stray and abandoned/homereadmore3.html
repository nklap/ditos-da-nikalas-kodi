      <h5 class="homereadmore3-h5">1. The oldest known pet cat existed 9,500 years ago</h5>
      <div class="container postscontainer">
          <p class="homereadmore3-p">This interesting fact about cats is guaranteed to wow at your next dinner party. Did you know that originally it was thought that Egyptians domesticated the cat? But in 2004, French archaeologists discovered a 9,500 year old cat grave in Cyprus. This makes this the oldest known pet cat and it predates Egyptian art about cats by over 4,000 years!</p>

      <div class="container postscontainer">
          <p class="homereadmore3-p">If you thought cats spent a lot of their lives sleeping, you’d be right. According to Veterinary Hub, Cats actually spend 70% of their lives sleeping, which works out to around 13-16 hours a day. It’s a cat’s life!</p>

      <div class="container postscontainer">
          <p class="homereadmore3-p">An orange tabby cat called Stubbs was the mayor of Talkeetna, a small town in Alaska for 20 years! He had several uncontested elections and although he didn’t hold any legislative power, he was loved by locals and tourists alike.</p>

Those are some big cats.</p>

      </div>

      <h5 class="homereadmore3-h5">7. Isaac Newton invented the cat door</h5>
      <div class="container postscontainer">
          <p class="homereadmore3-p">The scientist is most famous for calculated gravity, but it’s also believed that Isaac Newton invented the cat door. How Stuff Works writes that when Newton was working on his experiments at the University of Cambridge he was constantly interrupted by his cats scratching at the door. So he called the Cambridge carpenter to saw two holes in the door, one for the mother cat and one for her kittens! Apparently these holes can still be seen at the university today.</p>
